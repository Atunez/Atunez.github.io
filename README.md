## How to play

To play Osu!, you first need to install beatmaps, then you can start clicking them!

### Getting beatmaps

To install a beatmap, first go to [this website](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets). You will need to sign in on the website before you can downaload any beatmap.

It should look like this:
![Capture1.PNG](https://github.com/Atunez/Atunez.github.io/blob/main/pictures/Capture1.PNG?raw=true)

You will be able to look up any song in the search bar. For example, when looking up the song "Zen Zen Zense," it should look like this:
![Capture2.PNG](https://github.com/Atunez/Atunez.github.io/blob/main/pictures/Capture2.PNG?raw=true)

Clicking on the first beatmap, we get to this screen:
![Capture3.PNG](https://github.com/Atunez/Atunez.github.io/blob/main/pictures/Capture3.PNG?raw=true)

You can then click on "Download," and then open the downloaded file. If the game is close, this will open the game and load the map in the game, otherwise it will just load it in the game. Beatmaps have the file type of .osu

Note: Some beatmaps may have two different download options which would be "with video" or "without video". The download process is the same regardless, and the different may be seen in the game when playing the beatmap. 

### Gameplay Mechanics

When selecting a beatmap, and opening it you will see your cursor, alongside different game objects.

You can move your cursor with your mouse, and you can hit objects with either mouse buttons, or with the keyboard using Z and X. 

Note: the keyboard binds can be change in the in-game settings.

The game has 3 different objects: circles, sliders, and spinners.

#### Circles

Here is how a circle hit object would look in the game:

![Capture4.PNG](https://github.com/Atunez/Atunez.github.io/blob/main/pictures/Capture4.PNG?raw=true)

When the outter circle overlaps with the white edge of the inner circle, that is when you should click on the circle.

#### Sliders

Here is how a slider object would look in the game:

![Capture5.PNG](https://github.com/Atunez/Atunez.github.io/blob/main/pictures/Capture5.PNG?raw=true)

Similar to the circle hit objects, when the outter circle overlaps with the white edge of the inner circle, that is when you should click on the sliderhead (the side that had a number).

#### Spinners

Here is how a spinner hit object would look in the game:

![Capture6.PNG](https://github.com/Atunez/Atunez.github.io/blob/main/pictures/Capture6.PNG?raw=true)

Unlike the circles and sliders, for sliders you only need to click and then spin with your cursor.


For more details, you can follow the in-game tutorial beatmap.

## FAQ

### Question: How is difficulty calculated?

Difficulty depends on many factors. However, the main factors include Approach rate, circle size, HP drain, amount of objects and the speed of the beatmap.

### Question: How is scoring calculated?

Score in the game depends on accuracy and combo.

Accuracy is how late or early you hit an object, with you hitting it closer to the actual time giving you more points than not.

Combo is how many objects you have hit consecutivly, with higher combo giving you more score since it acts as a multiplier.

When the game is played on Score V2, the score is capped at one million or less, regardless of accuracy or combo.

### Question: Why am I seeings white lines when playing?

You may see white lines when you press C, these lines are smoke and are just a visiual thing.

### Question: Is it possible to change skins?

Yes!

You can download a skin from the internet, then load in the game by clicking on the file that is download, and then selecting that skin in the settings.

Note: skins have the file type of .osz
